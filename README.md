# SIC Compiler
This is a program that compiles a SIC program into machine code written in python.

To run the program, just run the main.py file. It will first ask you the name of the file you want to compile.
The file must be in the same directory as the main.py file and must have the extension .sic.

After the file is compiled, you will be able to see it in the output directory with the same name as the input file but with the extension .obj.
